### Introduction & How to Play
This was our team project from Mod2 at Turing School of Software & Design. We had 9 days to build this Star Wars themed Jeopardy game. The game is developed for 3 players and has three rounds. There are two rounds with 16 clues where each player can select from the remaining boxes on the game board. The first round has one Daily Double and the second round has two Daily Doubles. The third round is Final Jeopardy where each player can wager a bet based on their current points to answer a unique question. After that, the winning player is displayed.<br>

Our group's focus for this project was to practice our Object Oriented Programming skills and work with `fetch()` requests to pull all game data including questions and answers from a live server on page load. We created a testing suite for all our class files to practice Test Driven Development. We also spent time making our program accessible for those with certain disabilities by semantically naming our elements and ensuring our game can be played using only the tab and enter key.

### Project Learning Goals  
  1. Write a program from scratch
  2. Synthesize knowledge of OOP, classes, and JS fundamentals to create a playable game
  3. Demonstrate good GitHub collaboration and workflow within a large group
  4. Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
  5. Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application
  6. Implement array iterator and mutator methods to work with game data
